<h3 align="center">TypeScript Course Curriculum - <a href="https://hn.ui.dev/">Hacker News Clone</a></h3>

### Info

This is the repository for UI.dev's "TypeScript" course curriculum project.

For more information on the course, visit **[ui.dev/typescript](https://ui.dev/typescript/)**.

### Project

This is a (soft) "Hacker News" clone.

You can view the final project at **[hn.ui.dev](https://hn.ui.dev/)**

For the solution, I chose to build the project using vanilla JavaScript DOM APIs and Webpack to bundle the code. You could go that route; You could also try to build the project as a webserver using NodeJS. The only requirement is that you use TypeScript.

This course doesn't cover using TypeScript with front-end frameworks, like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte. This is because the type definitions for these packages can be a little complicated and I didn't want to over-complicate the course. If you are feeling ambitious, feel free to try building this project with the framework of your choice.

### Solution

If you get stuck, you can view my solution by checking out the `solution` branch.

### Approaches

There are a few different ways you can approach this, each with varying difficulties.

- Hardest: Look at the [finished project](https://hn.ui.dev/) and build it. This is obviously the hardest approach but the one you'll gain the most learning from. The only thing that you'll need is the documentation for the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

- Easiest: Take 10-15 minutes to walk through [my code](https://github.com/uidotdev/typescript-course-curriculum/tree/solution). Notice how I approached different problems and how you may or may not want to do something similar. From there, start building and reference my project only as you need it.
